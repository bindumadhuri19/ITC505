        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p><strong>Minor Project - Design and Simulation of I Shaped Microstrip Patch Antenna at 2.4Ghz:</strong> The I-shaped geometry was chosen for its potential to enhance antenna performance, such as improved bandwidth and radiation characteristics. Through simulation, I analyzed the antenna's impedance matching, radiation pattern, and gain. It’s a lower frequency range that provides good coverage and penetration through obstacles.</p>
        <p><strong>Major Project - Design and Analysis of Patch Antenna for IOT Applications at 28Ghz:</strong> In this project, I focused on designing and analyzing a microstrip rectangular patch antenna specifically tailored for IoT (Internet of Things) applications. The antenna operates at a frequency of 28 GHz, allowing for faster data transmission, suitable for short-range high-bandwidth and IoT devices like smart home sensors and wearables.</p>
        <p><strong>Internship - Sensitive label privacy Preservation with Anatomization for Data Publishing:</strong> I have done this project using Java technology. The main aim is to implement techniques and strategies to protect sensitive information and maintain privacy using an anatomization scheme.</p>

           <h2>Addendum: Explanation of Stylistic Choices</h2>
           
           <p>I made several deliberate choices in styling my resume to enhance its readability and visual appeal. Here are the key decisions and their rationale:</p>
           
           <h3>Font Choices:</h3>
           <p>I opted for Georgia as the main font family with serif as fallback. This choice provides a traditional and elegant look, enhancing the professional appearance of the resume.</p>
           
           <h3>Sizes of Headings and Main Text Size:</h3>
           <p>For headings, I used <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> for the main title "Resume - Bindu Madhuri Chalasani" to signify its importance as the highest-level heading. Subsequent headings like <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> were used hierarchically to maintain consistency and readability throughout the content. The main text size is set to 16px with a line height of 1.6 to ensure a comfortable reading experience.</p>
           
           <h3>Color Choices:</h3>
           <p>I chose dark (#333) text on a light background (#fff) to maintain contrast and readability. This combination ensures that text stands out clearly and is easy to read.</p>
           
           <h3>Margin and Padding Choices:</h3>
           <p>Throughout the document, I applied margins and paddings strategically to improve visual hierarchy and spacing. For example, a 20px margin on the body element provides space between content and screen edges, enhancing clarity and focus. Sections have a 40px bottom margin to visually separate content areas, while headers and footers have padding for additional spacing and aesthetic appeal.</p>
           
           <h3>HTML Abuse:</h3>
           <p>I corrected instances from previous assignments where HTML tags were chosen based on visual appearance rather than semantic meaning. For instance, ensuring the main title "Resume - Bindu Madhuri Chalasani" is marked up with <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> to reflect its hierarchical importance.</p>
