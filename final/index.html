            <h2>Addendum</h2>
            <p>During the development of the "Lights Out" game, several key aspects were addressed:</p>

            <h3>1. Initial Setup:</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Objective:</strong> Create a playable "Lights Out" game.<br>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> Started with an all-white board and used simulated clicks to configure the board, ensuring it's always solvable.
            </p>

            <h3>2. CSS Class Management:</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Objective:</strong> Manage square states with CSS classes.<br>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> Used the `.is-off` class to represent the "off" state, keeping JavaScript simple and clean.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Visual Enhancements:</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Objective:</strong> Improve game appearance and usability.<br>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> Added animations and styled the board and controls for better user experience.
            </p>

            <h3>Challenges and Solutions</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Game Solvability:</strong> Ensured solvability by starting with an all-white board and using simulated clicks.<br>
                <strong>User Interface Design:</strong> Created a clean design and added animations for usability.<br>
                <strong>Hint Mechanism:</strong> Implemented a hint feature that highlights the best square without making the game too easy.
            </p>

            <h3>Insights Gained</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>User Experience:</strong> Enhancements like animations and clear feedback improve the game experience.<br>
                <strong>Solvability:</strong> Starting from a solvable state and introducing randomness maintains puzzle integrity.<br>
                <strong>Modular Code Design:</strong> Separating CSS and JavaScript concerns leads to more maintainable code.
