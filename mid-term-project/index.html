                <h3>Process and Creative Choices</h3>
                <p><strong>Planning:</strong> Before coding, I outlined the flow of the story, identifying key choices and potential endings. I created a flowchart to visualize how different paths would connect, ensuring a coherent narrative structure.</p>
                <p><strong>HTML Structure:</strong> I designed the HTML layout to facilitate easy user interaction, using semantic elements like <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>. This structure helped keep the story, choices, and images organized.</p>
                <p><strong>CSS Styling:</strong> A minimalist design was chosen to maintain focus on the narrative. I opted for a soothing color palette to enhance user engagement and ensure responsiveness across various devices.</p>
                <p><strong>JavaScript Functionality:</strong> JavaScript was used to manage interactivity. I structured the story as a series of objects, each containing properties for text, choices, and associated images.This made it easy to update and manage branching paths.</p>
                <p><strong>Challenges Faced:</strong><ul>
                        <li>Managing story branching was complex. I tackled this by implementing a JSON-like structure, which simplified updates.</li>
                        <li>Ensuring images loaded correctly was tricky. I addressed this with preloading and error handling.</li>
                        <li>Balancing narrative depth with user engagement required iteration. User testing helped refine the experience.</li></ul></p>
                <p><strong>Insights Gained:</strong><ul>
                        <li>Meaningful choices increased user investment in the narrative.</li>
                        <li>An iterative approach was crucial for improvement.</li>
                        <li>Accessibility features made the game more inclusive.</li></ul></p>
